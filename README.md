# TwitterSentimentAnalysis
AI-ML(CSPC-54) Project

The process of computationally determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative, or neutral is known as sentiment analysis. Itâ€™s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.

This web application has been developed with Python and the Flask Framework. To categorise consumer sentiment on a scale of -1 to 1, with -1 denoting a strongly unfavourable reaction to the keyword(s) and 1 denoting a strongly positive one, where users can give keywords as input to retrieve real-time Twitter text based on the keyword and read it to find out how customers are feeling.

In particular, this project mines data by using well known "Tweepy" API. The Tweepy API establishes a real-time connection with Twitter and collects text and metadata from the Twitter platform.
